# Internship Experience at AlphaBits Technology

# About the Internship
I had the incredible opportunity to intern at Alphabits Technology as a Data Science Intern. The internship lasted for 6 weeks, during which I worked on a variety of tasks and projects related to data science and analytics.

# Achievements
* üèÜ Received the <b>Best Intern Award</b> in recognition of my contributions and dedication.
* üìú Received a <b>Letter of Recommendation</b> and <b> Certefication of Completion</b> highlighting my achievements and skills acquired during the internship.

# Projects
### Project 1: Brush up your Knowledge
<b>Duration:</b> Week 1
<b>Description:</b> Some topic names releated to Data Science are given by them and I had to write those topic ans and make PDF.
### Project 2: Fundamentals of Data Analytics.(EDA)
<b>Duration:</b> Week 2
<b>Description:</b> It's a Minor Project 1, by using Books dataset I perform EDA and visualization.

### Project 3: Telecom Customer Churn and Revenue Prediction using Python
<b>Duration:</b> Week 3
<b>Description:</b> It's a Minor Project 2, Using telecom churn dataset recognize the features to build a ML model that can predict
whether a customer is going to churn out or remain in the company. Also, if the customer remains with the company then build a model to predict the possible revenue that company can generate from them, so this task was there for week 3.

### Project 4: Titanic Survival Prediction using  Data Science , Machine Learning in Python
<b>Duration:</b> Week 4
<b>Description:</b> It's a Minor Project 3, in this task titanic dataset were used. And i had to perform some data cleaning, EDA, Model selection related activities. 

### Project 5: Movie Recommendation System using Data Science, Machine Learning with Python
<b>Duration:</b> Week 5
<b>Description:</b> It's a Minor Project 4, in this task Movie recommandation dataset were used. And i had to perform some data cleaning, EDA, Model selection related activities and  claculate the accuracy, Confussion matrix, etc.

### Project 6: Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
<b>Duration:</b> Week 6
<b>Description:</b> It's a Final Project, in this task Crop dataset were used. Machine learning in agriculture has the potential to be applied to various areas with
outstanding results, from detecting weeds and diseases, predicting yield and quality of
crops, to gathering data, providing insights, and offering predictions regarding livestock
production.and also it can able to advice former based on features like N,P,K
,temperature,humidity which crop he should use.it help former to get better yield.
Following steps are used:
1. dataset importing
2. data analysis
3. data preprocessing
4. feature selection
5. machine learning model training

6. test machine learning models
7. compare multiple machine learning models
8. conclude the result.
